# Container management systems

---

## Docker Swarm

- From Docker Inc.
- Takes care of scheduling containers on multiple hosts
- Same API as Docker engine -> same tools
- [Swarm documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/)
- K8s support in beta

Note:

(TODO: rephrase and clarify Docker/Swarm/K8s relation/support)

---

## Kubernetes (K8s)

- From Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)
- Originally developed by Google, donated 2015
- Now developed by Google, Red Hat, CoreOS, ...
- Open source, one of the biggest and most active projects in
  GitHub
- Google Container Engine (GKE) implements K8s API
- Some notable workloads
  - [GitHub frontend](https://githubengineering.com/kubernetes-at-github/)
  - [Pok√©mon Go](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/09/bringing-Pokemon-GO-to-life-on-Google-Cloud.html)
  - [Philips lightbulbs](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-kubernetes/)
- [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/)

Note:

(TODO: add picture from CNCF showing K8s contribution activity)

---

## OpenShift

- From Red Hat
- "Enterprise Kubernetes for Developers"
- Open source ([github.com/openshift](https://github.com/openshift))
- Batteries included
  - application templates
  - fairly complete Web UI
  - CD/CI
- [www.openshift.com](https://www.openshift.com)

## OpenShift versions

- OpenShift Origin
  - community supported
  - run on CentOS-7, Fedora, Atomic Host
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform    
  - Red Hat support, runs on supported OS stacks
- OpenShift operated by Red Hat in a public cloud
  - OpenShift Online - shared
  - OpenShift Dedicated    

---

## OpenShift platform development model

- Development is very open
  - https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues
  - https://trello.com/atomicopenshift
- Based on a stable K8s version, a few releases behind from bleeding edge
- Ahead of K8s in some areas
  - security, multitenancy
- RH contributes to upsteam K8s releases, then
  later switches to using upstream features in OpenShift

---

## OpenShift releases

- Currently (Nov 2017) we are on 3.6.1
- Up to 1.5 there was two versioning schemes
  - 3.x for commercial
  - 1.x for Origin
- Minor number shows K8s release (3.6 -> 1.6)
- In the future OpenShift could be just K8s extensions

## Motivation: SEP

- Why container orchestration system instead of XYZ

---

## Somebody Else's Problem

- Network isolation - SEP
- Container and project isolation - SEP
- Process keepalive - SEP
- Capacity management - SEP
- CI/CD orchestration - SEP
- Service location - SEP
- HA load balancing - SEP
- Storage - SEP
- DNS name for the application - SEP
- Server certificates - SEP
- Authorization for delegating management rights - SEP

---

## Services and other useful stuff (with demos)

- Application templates
- Docker registry
  - accessible from outside
- WebUI for Docker registry
- Container resource usage monitoring
  - CPU, memory, network
- Terminal access to running containers
  - no host login required
- Centralized logging

---

## Security in OpenShift - infrastructure

- Infra nodes (masters, etcd, lb, glusterfs) do not run user processes
- User nodes have limited access to infra
- Masters are the only ones that talk to etcd (state)

---

## Security in OpenShift - containers

- Isolation: based on Linux kernel
- (ClearContainers: KVM)
- SELinux contexts per project
- User ID per project
  - taken from high range
  - no overlaps
- Extra process capabilities are dropped
- No user namespaces yet, thus no (local) root in containers
- Network: SDN per project
- Storage: SELinux labeling (for supported storage types)

---

## Security in OpenShift - runtime privileges

- Containers can request additional capabilities
- Accounts can be given rights to use (for example)
  - host network stack
  - fixed UIDs
  - root UID
- These privileges are abstracted as Security Context Constraints (SCC)
- In a shared environment, access to these is mostly reserved to system components

## Comparison to other platforms

|                           | Virtual hosting | IaaS Cloud  | Container cloud   |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |         
| **Model**                 | pet VMs         | cattle VMs  | cattle containers |
| **Unit**                  | VM              | VM          | container         |
| **Avail for single unit** | high            | medium      | low               |
| **Automatic recovery**    | yes             | DIY         | yes               |
| **Level of abstraction**  | low             | low         | high              |
| **Ease of scaling**       | low             | medium      | trivial           |
| **Non-Linux workloads**   | yes             | yes         | hard              |
